SHORTNOVEL: Draft 1 

   The generator next to him exploded in a deafening sound. Everything seemed to mute and froze for a second. He opened his eyes and resumed his course.  
  An ornithopter was behind him, and the laser cannon was thundering red flashes of plasma. He was doing what he could to escape this flying machine. He ran between the generators and the boxes. The flapping sound of the wings was invading his hears. 

(A DÉPLACER?)
  He was living on Exor, a planet mainly oceanic, with some big islands scattered within. He was living on the biggest, Pando. Every isles started from villages to one megalopolis, those bigs "Megs", as the population was reffering to it. And right now, he was on the west coast, close to the ocean.

  He was running. Toward the end of the road. A couple more seconds and he was going to be safe from the orni. He just  had to make it to the stockroom's hallway's passes. The laser shoot above him, cutting his way off. He had to turn right, and to run along his life-saving door. He ran for a few seconds and turned to his right again. He was seeing it. His treading was getting bigger, and he jumped to enter the stockroom.  
  He lied down on the ground but was already hearing the footstep coming to him. Two guards were running toward him, laser gun in hands. He stood up and drew out a pistol from his pocket. He shoots. The first guards took a bullet in the leg and falled. The second fired immediately and burned the skin of the runner. He stopped and threw on the floor, pointing his gun in front of him. He was triyng not to shake and breathed. He was letting the movements of the past flows in him. He was remembering.

  The sunrise was starting to shine on the city of Pando. Ranlo had taken the habit of starting his day with the sun when he was a kid. His father used to say to him that «Futur is for early birds.»
He was now 24, and he had kept this habit since then. The other thing that Ranlo had kept since his childhood was his admiration for the Pando's army. He was now ready to enter this fabulous institution and follow his dream. His parents were secretly hoping that he took the following of his father, as the chairman of the enterprise. His mother was the second of his father, her confidante, her advisor. She knew a lot in the deepest nodes of the company and knew how to use it to help her husband. But she was the kindest mom. She loved her kid more than anything and so does his father. 

  Ranlo was overexcited. He passed the test with confidence. He had learned them all. Maths. Physics. History of the great battles: The guerilla of Fongtrop, The submarine war of 3594 and the others. He knew it all. This planet, Exor, had a long history of battles, and it wasn't going to stop soon.
The health test had been smoothly and he was now passing the mental test. His brain was analyzed by a computer, which indicates the eventual diseases. The war was an art here. The art. Only the best people were send to war. 
  
  This exam was taken by all at the âge of 24. By the results to all the test, they were given a "maximum rank" that they could reach in life, but not necessarily. Some could be a doctor but, after wrong choices, ended up as a clerk.
Everybody was then encouraged to become the best they could, by improving themselves. The system existed since longer than anyone could remember. 
The ultimate goal was to be in the on best percent of result and become a soldier. The elite. 

  Ranlo was in this percentage. He made it. He was going to pursue his dream. He left his family two weeks after the exam, with his parents until the last moment. He was transported at the north of the island, where the soldiers were trained. And so his life really began.

  He breathed and shot. The guard stopped, a laser in his stomach. He saw the clothes and the hands of the guard flooded by red and black. He ran again. More guards were coming. He had to hide.
« I going to find it. I HAVE to find it ! », he taught. « It's the only way to end this madness. »
He spotted a corridor, which seemed to go deeper inside the room … and the ground. Inside the corridor there was a stair. They were never stair inside the ground. Except at one place.

  No inhabitants had the right to go more than 5 meters inside the ground. That was the only rule. Only some places, accredited by the Military Intelligence, had the right to. Too much holes at too much places could broke the island. That would be the end. The only holes were to find deep pocket of first resources for the need of everybody.
But no one knew that the military training camp had his underground complex. And that's where everything was really happening.
